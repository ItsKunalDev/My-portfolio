                    <p>
                        I have created a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using both JavaScript and C++. Additionally, I
                        developed a Number-Guessing Game using C++ that interacts with the system. Alongside these, I
                        designed a simple website using HTML and CSS. These projects demonstrate my skills in
                        programming and web development. They showcase my ability to build interactive games and
                        visually appealing websites.

                <p>
                    I have explored Web Development through several projects, showcasing my growing skills in the field.
                    My first project was a simple website created using HTML and CSS, where I learned the basics of web
                    design and styling. For my second project, I developed a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript, which enhanced my understanding of interactivity and logic implementation. My third
                    project was building my personal portfolio website, reflecting my creativity and technical
                    expertise. Currently, I am working on an exciting movie website, which further expands my knowledge
                    in web development.

                <h3>JAVA AND C++</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently learning Java and have a strong foundation in C++. Using C++, I have developed
                    several projects that demonstrate my programming skills. One of my projects was a Number Guessing
                    Game, where I implemented logic to engage users interactively. Another project was a
                    Rock-Paper-Scissors game, showcasing my understanding of game mechanics and user input handling.
                    These projects have helped me enhance my problem-solving abilities and programming expertise.
